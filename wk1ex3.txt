# I decided to go with a fairly simple (but I think effective)
# algorithm, almost hitting the 6 lines! Couldn't get rude
# of the last one sadly enough :(
#

# First go to the ceiling and to the corner
0 xx** -> E 0
0 xE** -> N 0
0 NEx* -> W 2

# Go east until hitting a wall
1 *x** -> E 1
1 *E** -> S 2

# Go west until hitting a wall
2 **x* -> W 2
2 **W* -> S 1
